Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 20.01.2025

At AI Style Changer - AI Fashion ("we," "our," or "us"), we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle the information you provide when using our mobile application (the "App").

1. Information We Collect

We only collect the following data from you:

Photos and Images:
When you upload a photo for styling, we use the image solely for the purpose of generating the result with the selected clothing. These images are processed by our app but are not stored or shared with third parties.
2. How We Use Your Information

The images you upload are used exclusively to create a styled image by combining your photo with the selected clothing. We do not store or retain your personal data once the styling process is complete.

Styling Process:
The photos you upload are temporarily used to generate the styled image. Once the image is processed, it is available for you to save or share, but we do not store your original images after the process is finished.

No Long-Term Storage:
We do not retain any images or data once the image generation process is complete. Your photos are processed and discarded from our servers immediately after use.

3. How We Share Your Information

We do not share your personal data or images with any third parties. Your data is only used for the sole purpose of generating the styled images within the app.

4. Data Security

We take reasonable steps to ensure that your photos are processed securely during the image generation process. However, as we do not store your photos or personal data, there is no long-term data security risk.

5. Your Choices

Since we do not retain any of your personal data after processing, there is no need for you to take any additional actions to manage your data within the app.

Accessing or Updating Your Data:
As we do not store your data, there is no personal information or images for you to access, update, or delete once the styling process is complete.
6. Children's Privacy

Our app is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect photos or personal data from children. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete it immediately.

7. Third-Party Links

Our app may contain links to external websites or services. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these third-party sites and encourage you to review their privacy policies.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the updated policy in the app and revise the "Effective Date" at the top. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we handle your information.
